ZTM Secion 12 - Server and Backdoor in Python

This section requires you to create a really basic backdoor and server with the following functionality:
- Upload files to the target machine
- Download files from the target machine
- Clear the screen
- Quit the connection and close the backdoor file on the target machine
- Traverse directories with CD

Potential to keep building on this to add privilege escalation, persistence, error handling etc.
